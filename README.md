Vodafone Qatar is a major telecom provider offering mobile, broadband, IoT, managed services, and devices. The company is in the middle of a digital transformation expanding 5G, boosting digital adoption, and focusing on customer experience. Vodafone Qatar serves thousands of customers in a fast-changing telecom market.

Main goals: Keep customers happy, grow revenue, and maintain strong network performance.

Challenges today:
*   Customer churn
*   Unexplained revenue and usage fluctuations
*   Localized network issues

Right now, the company mostly looks at past data – we need tools to predict problems before they happen.

Our goal is to leverage this dataset to optimize telecom operations by answering questions like:

Customer Retention
*   Which customer or segment is at risk of churning?
*   What factors (complaints, ARPU, 5G coverage, digital adoption) influence churn?

Revenue & ARPU Forecasting
*   How will ARPU and revenue change over the next quarters?
*   Can we detect patterns that influence revenue growth?

Network & Digital Impact
*   Does improving 5G coverage or digital transactions reduce churn and boost ARPU?
*   Which operational KPI correlates most with profitability?
